/**
 * Enumerables:
    - Enumerables refer to properties in an object that can be iterated over using a for...in loop. 
    - Enumerables include all the properties of an object that are directly accessible and can be enumerated.
    - The for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of the person object (name, age, and city).
    - Enumerables are typically used with objects and are not specific to iteration order.
    - Example: Enumerating over the properties of an object using a for...in loop

 * Iterables: 
    - Iterables are objects that implement the iterable protocol., aallow them to be iterated over using the for...of loop  or other iterable-consumer methods.
    - They define a method called [Symbol.iterator] that returns an iterator object.
    - Iterators provide a way to traverse a collection one element at a time.
    - Iterables are used with various built-in JavaScript objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc., and can define their own custom iteration behavior.
    - Example: Iterating over an array using a for...of loop.

/**
 * Both Enumerables & Iterables Data Type In Javascript : 
 * In JavaScript, several data types are both enumerable and iterable, meaning they can be iterated over using various looping constructs and methods. 
 * Arrays: 
    - Arrays in JavaScript are both enumerable and iterable. 
    - They can be iterated over using the for...of loop, Array.forEach(), or other iterable-consumer methods.
 * Strings: 
    - Strings are also both enumerable and iterable. 
    - The characters of a string can be iterated over using the for...of loop or other iterable-consumer methods.
 * Maps: 
    - Maps in JavaScript are enumerable and iterable data structures that store key-value pairs. 
    - They can be iterated over using the for...of loop, Map.forEach(), or other iterable-consumer methods.
 * Sets: 
    - Sets are enumerable and iterable data structures that store unique values. 
    - They can be iterated over using the for...of loop or other iterable-consumer methods.

    - They provide more flexibility compared to the for...of loop, 
      as you can decide when to retrieve the next element and handle the iteration state accordingly.
    - Enumerators are objects that facilitate the iteration over enumerables by providing an interface to access the elements of the enumerable sequentially. 
    - Enumerators have a next() method that returns the next element in the iteration and tracks the iteration state.
    - Enumerators are typically obtained by invoking the [Symbol.iterator] method on an enumerable. 
    - The [Symbol.iterator] method returns an iterator object that implements the iterator protocol. 
    - The iterator object, in turn, has the next() method.
